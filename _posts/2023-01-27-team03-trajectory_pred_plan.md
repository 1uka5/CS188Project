## Introduction
In recent years, the computer vision community has became more involved in automonomous vehicle. With evergrowing hardware support, trajectory prediction--predicting the flow of traffic--is yielding more promising results. The introduction of Transformer technique also galvanized the deep learning community, and our team will explore the application of Transformer in trajectory prediction.
